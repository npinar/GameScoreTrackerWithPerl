# GameScoreTrackerWithPerl
The project is developed with Perl 5.12

This is a simple project to learn perl basics. This small application prompts the user and give options to either add a new game stat or print all the data that is in the file. 

You can reference this code to learn:
How to create a class and instantiate it in perl
How to create methods in perl
How to write and read a file
How to obtain user inputs
Usage of while loops and if conditions.

Coming up:
My next step is to use regex with perl to create game stats such as average game scores, etc.
